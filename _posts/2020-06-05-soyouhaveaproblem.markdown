title: So You Have a Problem
---

So the last few weeks I was working on this song and animation. It was fun (and a bit exhausting sometimes). The result is a video you can send to someone who should just use Google. If you want to see and hear more like this in the future, please consider sharing this video with your friends or even support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lolnein). Thank you so much! :)


If you like it, share it with your friends.
If you hate it, show it to your enemies.


Thank you! :)
