With Halloween approaching, I felt the urge to make a spooky song so a few weeks ago I recorded a short part just for fun. Then I thought it had potential so I wanted to make it into a whole song.

But with my "Smartphone's Answer Song" project taking so long, I didn't feel comfortable to just start working on another song and video. Until last weekend, when I got to a point where I can FINALLY say that it's almost finished. So I quickly started working on expanding the Halloween song: Write more verses, record the vocals, finish the track, and make a small video. And here it is! Because I had just so little time, it's "just" a video with lyrics. I hope, you'll have fun with it anyway :)

And if not, the Smartphone's music video is coming within the next few weeks. Can't wait to show it to you!

Once again, thank you so much for your patience and support!

Have a wonderful day :)
